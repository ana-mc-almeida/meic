### Q1.2 - What lessons can be drawn from the story? (Max 400 characters)

The case shows that robust <107> Corporate Governance and comprehensive <135> Risk Management are critical when adopting a <404> Cloud-First Strategy. The absence of clear <131> Accountability and failure to conduct a <417> DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) led to significant operational and reputational risks, underlining the need for thorough <110> Due Diligence in digital transformation projects.

## Q2 - What case had you selected for this Eassay?

The failure to achieve <412> Digital Maturity and align stakeholders led to low adoption and public criticism.

### Q2.2 - What lessons can be drawn from the case? (Max 400 characters)

The case underscores the importance of <112> Governance to ensure Stakeholder Engagement and effective <414> Digital Strategy.
