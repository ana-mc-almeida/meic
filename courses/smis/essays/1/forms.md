## Q1 - What story had you selected for this Eassay?

VisioRetail CEO Shuffle 

### Q1.1 - How is the story related to the theme? (Max 400 characters)

The story exposes <107> Corporate Governance failures (CEO’s centralized power, passive <102> BoD) and weak <118> Management (<115> Internal Controls, inconsistent <116> KPIs). It reveals how poor <112> Governance (no <110> Due Diligence) and toxic <124> Organizational Culture led to strategic blindness, aligning with Theme 1’s focus on oversight.

### Q1.2 - What lessons can be drawn from the story? (Max 400 characters)

The story shows how <113> GRC frameworks (<107> Governance with <102> BoD oversight, <135> Risk mitigation via <110> Due Diligence, and <106> Compliance) could have prevented the crisis. It also highlights aligning <124> Organizational Culture with <112> Governance through <120> Management Systems for consistent <116> KPIs and accountability.

## Q2 - What case had you selected for this Eassay?

<4> OpenAI and the Boardroom Shockwave (2023)

### Q2.1 - How is the case related to the theme? (Max 400 characters)

The case exposes critical failures in <107> Corporate Governance: the <102> BoD’s opaque decision-making clashed with operational realities, lacking <131> RACI clarity. It highlights risks of hybrid governance models (non-profit/commercial) and poor <124> Organizational Culture alignment.

### Q2.2 - What lessons can be drawn from the case? (Max 400 characters)

The case reveals that <107> Corporate Governance fails when <102> BoD decisions lack <110> Due Diligence, while <113> GRC integration could prevent such crises. The staff revolt underscores how <124> Organizational Culture and <117> Leadership stability depend on clear <131> RACI frameworks to maintain trust during governance transitions.

## Q3 - Seminar Discussion Prompt

### Q3.1 - Propose a discussion question related to the theme for use in the seminar. (Max 100 characters)

How can organizations align governance structures with culture to ensure strategic resilience?

### Q3.2 - Justify the relevance of the proposed issue from the perspective of the theme. (Max 400 characters)

Both the VisioRetail and OpenAI cases reveal that misalignment between governance structures and organizational culture leads to instability and poor decision-making. This question encourages debate on how integrated GRC systems and clear leadership accountability can foster resilient and well-managed organizations.
