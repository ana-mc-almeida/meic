# Q4

## Notes from moodle:

Fictional Scenario and Conceptual Reflection. This question requires a plausible, professional narrative where you lead a team supporting a client from a relevant sector. Please ensure:

- The client’s identity and your role are clearly stated. In a few examples a reader can question wheather you are not an internal employee (and not a leader of an external support team...)
- The situation reflects a realistic problem (e.g., weak procedures, technical gaps, organisational complexity).
  - Specially, if the issue is due to a sistemic failure of the costumer's business, it must be clear what aspect (governance, management, operational,...) it is related;
  - If it is due to an individual incompetence or negligence, that must be framed carefully, with appropriate professional and ethical interpretation. Example: if one of your team members makes a wrong software update as part of his/her role, that is maybe your fault and not of your costumer, resulting bad to your reputation and probably in contractual penalizations for you; if he/she makes an unautorized software update, than that might be a failure in the costumer's security management framework...
