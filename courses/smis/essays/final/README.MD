### [Q4](./Q4/README.md)

Task: Imagine that you successfully completed this course in the past and are now a senior professional working in a well-performing IT services firm. Construct a fictional but plausible scenario where you lead a team supporting a client from one of the business domains explored during the course project (you are free to choose what industry), and:

- A junior team member’s negative behaviour forced you to intervene in a situation that ideally should not have needed your involvement.
- Another junior member proved instrumental in helping you address a major challenge that you could not have successfully resolved alone.

Deliverable: A single 1-page PDF file, containing:

- At the top: the narrative of the fictional scenario.
- Below: an explanation of its relevance to the course, consisting of a conceptual map of up to 12 concepts highlighting the related course concepts and a textual commentary, assuring this links the story to concepts of the course.
