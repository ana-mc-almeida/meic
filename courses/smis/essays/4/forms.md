## Q1 - What story had you selected for this Eassay?

VisioRetail AI Misfire

### Q1.1 - How is the story related to the theme? (Max 400 characters)

The VisioRetail story highlights failures in aligning <426> IT Strategy with business goals. The push for <401> AI adoption lacked a clear <442> Target Operating Model (TOM), stakeholder engagement, and <429> portfolio governance. This disconnect between <311> IT Operations Management and strategic intent exemplifies poor management of IT-driven change.

### Q1.2 - What lessons can be drawn from the story? (Max 400 characters)

The case shows that <401> AI initiatives must be embedded in a coherent <414> Digital Strategy, supported by <406> Capability-Based Planning and stakeholder alignment. Ignoring <212> Governance of IT and <429> Strategic Portfolio review led to operational failure and cultural resistance. <421> Executive Sponsorship must include inclusive leadership and cross-functional coordination.

## Q2 - What case had you selected for this Eassay?

Sonos App Overhaul Fallout

### Q2.1 - How is the case related to the theme? (Max 400 characters)

The Sonos case illustrates a failure in aligning <426> IT Strategy with <414> Digital Strategy. The app overhaul ignored <420> Enterprise Architecture and lacked a <442> Target Operating Model, leading to stakeholder alienation. This disconnect between product development and strategic planning shows how poorly managed change can harm both user experience and brand value.

### Q2.2 - What lessons can be drawn from the case? (Max 400 characters)

Digital change must be guided by <429> Strategic Portfolio governance and involve early <421> Executive Sponsorship. Neglecting <423> Human-in-the-loop design and <422> Explainability in user-facing systems can damage <445> Value Proposition. Effective <403> Algorithmic System redesign needs Stakeholder Engagement to maintain trust and ensure successful adoption.

## Q3 - Seminar Discussion Prompt

### Q3.1 - Propose a discussion question related to the theme for use in the seminar. (Max 100 characters)

How can organisations ensure IT-driven change aligns with business strategy and stakeholder needs?

### Q3.2 - Justify the relevance of the proposed issue from the perspective of the theme. (Max 400 characters)

Misalignment between <426> IT Strategy and business goals, as seen in VisioRetail and Sonos, leads to failed transformations. Ensuring <420> Enterprise Architecture supports the <442> Target Operating Model and <414> Digital Strategy requires strong <421> Executive Sponsorship and inclusive <4.3> Stakeholder Engagement to deliver sustainable, user-aligned outcomes.

## Qx
