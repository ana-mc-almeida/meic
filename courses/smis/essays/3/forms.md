## Q1 - What story had you selected for this Eassay?

ArcoMed ransomware

### Q1.1 - How is the story related to the theme? (Max 400 characters)

The story of ArcoMed is related to <311> IT Operations Management (ITOM) as it highlights the challenges faced after migrating to a third-party cloud platform. The lack of <103> Business Continuity measures, insufficient <310> Incident Response and fragmented <316> Monitoring demonstrate a gap in managing IT services during a crisis, leading to operational failure.

### Q1.2 - What lessons can be drawn from the story? (Max 400 characters)

The story teaches that transitioning to cloud-based <306> IT infrastructure requires comprehensive <317> Operational Risk management, including robust Backup and Disaster Recovery plans. Adopting structured <217> ITSM frameworks like ITIL can enhance <310> Incident Response and ensure clear <323> Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to define roles and responsibilities during disruptions.

## Q2 - What case had you selected for this Eassay?

Colonial Pipeline and the Long Weekend

### Q2.1 - How is the case related to the theme? (Max 400 characters)

The Colonial Pipeline case highlights the importance of <311> IT Operations Management (ITOM) in maintaining the resilience of <318> Operational Technology (OT) when integrated with IT systems. The lack of coordination between IT and OT exposed the risks of inadequate <310> Incident Response and showed the need for robust <303> Cyber Resilience to handle cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.

### Q2.2 - What lessons can be drawn from the case? (Max 400 characters)

The case demonstrates the need for a well-structured <310> Incident Response Plan that integrates both IT and OT systems. Enhancing Operational Resiliencethrough comprehensive <317> Operational Risk management and ensuring <103> Business Continuity during cyber incidents are critical. Additionally, establishing <212> Governance of IT can support more agile decision-making and crisis response.

## Q3 - Seminar Discussion Prompt

### Q3.1 - Propose a discussion question related to the theme for use in the seminar. (Max 100 characters)

How can IT and OT integration be improved to enhance cyber resilience in critical sectors?

### Q3.2 - Justify the relevance of the proposed issue from the perspective of the theme. (Max 400 characters)

The Colonial Pipeline case showed that inadequate IT and <318> Operational Technology (OT) integration can disrupt critical infrastructure. Enhancing <303> Cyber Resilience through better coordination and integrated <310> Incident Response plans is vital. Addressing this issue aligns with <311> IT Operations Management (ITOM), ensuring continuity and minimizing operational risks.
