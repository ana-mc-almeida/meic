I enjoyed the presentation because it effectively captivated my attention.It utilized a video format that kept me engaged throughout instead of static PowerPoint slides. Despite the music seeming too loud during the classroom presentation, it was appropriately adjusted when I watched the video at home and the narrators' voice was clear and easily audible. Also the presentation itself was well-structured with the most relevant information presented using mostly key points without overwhelming details.

I was surprised by how much depth there is in the Transport and Logistics industry. It turned out to be an excellent central theme because it connects so easily with other niches like Manufacturing, Agriculture and Farming, and Healthcare due to its versatility.
