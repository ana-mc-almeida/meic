# P1 review

Groups number to review:

- 478
- 356
- 378

## Form

### Weakness - Consider your report and the other two assigned to you. Identify the most relevant weakness in any of those 3 reports and put here the number of that report:

378

### Explain - Explain here the weakness you had identified (this information will be anonimously shared with the class)

The report from group 378 presents the most relevant weakness among the three due to the quality of its industry comparisons. These comparisons are not very deep and, instead of critically analyzing the differences and similarities between sectors, they mainly describe each industry separately.

### Extra - (THIS WILL BE PRIVATE INFORMATION) Report here anything concerning this phase of the project that might be important to alert the academia (e.g., a coleague that underperformed, a colleague that should deserve a special recognition, ..., anything...):

Although there is no explicit indication of the group number or its members, I am assuming that the report from group 378 starts on page 316 of the PDF file 'ALL P1.pdf' and ends on page 323.
