# Slide 4: Governance of IT

> Governance of IT – IT’s role, governance structures, standards, compliance

## Must include

- Cybersecurity and data protection are core concerns of Route Optimization
- Cyber attacks can prove disastrous for the industry:
- Logistics and Transportation is a preferred target

## Slide description

**Role of IT**
In Transport Routes Optimization, IT enables real-time, data-driven logistics:

- **Routing Algorithms & <401> AI**: Used to process traffic, weather, and delivery data, similar to how predictive analytics guide production in **Smart Factories**.
- **Fleet & Asset Management**: Real-time tracking tools resemble **Healthcare scheduling systems** that monitor doctor availability and appointments, supported by robust <311> ITOM practices.
- **System Integration**: Enabled through <119> management frameworks, allowing integration between multiple management systems,similar to the coordination needed in **Crop-Farming Cooperatives** for managing supply chains and logistics networks.

**Governance Structures & Standards**

- **<106> Regulatory Compliance**: Follows transportation safety standards (e.g., ISO 39001), akin to medical data handling regulations in **Healthcare** or food safety in **Agriculture**, enforced by relevant <133> regulatory bodies within a <134> regulatory framework.
- **IT Governance Models**: Hybrid governance is common, combining central policies with local execution — also seen in **Smart Factories**, where plant-level autonomy aligns with corporate standards.
- **Data Governance**: Prioritizes GPS and operational data integrity, much like precision data management in **Crop Monitoring Systems** and **EHR systems** in Healthcare.

**Compliance & Risk**

- **<206> Cybersecurity**: Logistics platforms face ransomware and tracking system vulnerabilities, as do **Healthcare scheduling systems** managing sensitive patient data.
- **<103> Business Continuity**: Route optimization failures cause delivery disruptions — comparable to machinery downtime in **Smart Factories** or scheduling mismatches in **Hospital Rotas**.
- **Standards Adoption**: Involves <123> MSS and <119> management frameworks, also adopted by **Hospitals** and **Farming Cooperatives** undergoing digital transformation.
