Bloom's Taxonomy is an educational framework developed by psychologist Benjamin Bloom in the 1950s, highly influential in the field of education, especially in the development of cognitive skills.

It divides educational objectives into three "domains": Cognitive, Affective, and Psychomotor.

To facilitate critical thinking and encourage innovative ideas, we can use Bloom's Taxonomy **cognitive domain** as a guide to create questions that promote different levels of thinking.

This domain includes six levels:

1. **Remember**: This level involves the ability to recall previously learned information.
    - Examples of questions that promote this skill include: "What is the definition of...?", "List the main events of...".
2. **Understand**: Involves the ability to comprehend information and interpret it in one's own words.
    - Typical questions include: "Explain in your own words...", "What is the meaning of...?".
3. **Apply**: Focuses on applying learned concepts in new contexts or situations.
    - Questions could be: "How would you use this concept to solve...?", "What would happen if...?".
4. **Analyze**: Consists of the ability to examine information in detail, identifying patterns and relationships.
    - Examples of questions include: "What patterns can you find in...?", "What are the parts or functions of...?".
5. **Evaluate**: This level involves the ability to make judgments based on defined criteria.
    - Typical questions would be: "What is the best solution for... and why?", "Do you agree with this position? Justify your answer.".
6. **Create**: At the highest level of the taxonomy, individuals are able to produce new ideas or products that are original and unique.
    - Questions that stimulate this skill include: "How could you improve...?", "What ideas can you generate for...?".
