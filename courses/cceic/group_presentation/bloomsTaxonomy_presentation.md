### Slide 1

Blooms Taxonomy is a framework designed to help teachers structure learning experiences by classifing different levels of thinking. Its divided in 3 domains: cognitive, affective and psychomotor.

For this presentation, and how its about question techniques, we will focus on the cognitive domain.

### Slide 2

The cognitive domain is divided in 6 levels of thinking, from the simplest to the most complex:

The first one, Remember, is about recalling information. For example, remembering the definition of a concept.

The second one, Understand, is about explaining the information using your own words. 

The third one, Apply, is about using the information in a new context. For example, applying a concept to a real life situation.

The fourth one, Analyze, is about breaking down the information into parts. For example, identifying the different components of a system.

The fifth one, Evaluate, is about making judgements about the information. For example, deciding if a source is reliable or not.

And the last one, Create, is about generating new ideas.
