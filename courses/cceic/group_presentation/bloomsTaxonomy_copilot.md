## Introduction

Bloom's Taxonomy is a classification of the different objectives and skills that educators set for their students (learning objectives). It divides educational objectives into three "domains": Cognitive, Affective, and Psychomotor (sometimes loosely described as "knowing/head", "feeling/heart" and "doing/hands" respectively). Within the domains, learning at the higher levels is dependent on having attained prerequisite knowledge and skills at lower levels. A goal of Bloom's Taxonomy is to motivate educators to focus on all three domains, creating a more holistic form of education.

## 3 Domains of Bloom's Taxonomy

### Cognitive Domain

The cognitive domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the development of intellectual abilities and skills. There are six major categories, starting from the simplest behavior to the most complex. The categories are knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.

### Affective Domain

The affective domain involves our feelings, emotions, and attitudes. This domain includes the manner in which we deal with things emotionally, such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms, motivations, and attitudes. The five major categories are receiving, responding, valuing, organizing, and internalizing.

### Psychomotor Domain

The psychomotor domain involves the learning of physical skills. Coordination, and use of the motor-skill areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, distance, procedures, or techniques in execution. The seven major categories are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination.

## Conclusion

Bloom's Taxonomy is a useful tool for educators to ensure that their students are learning at the appropriate level. By using the taxonomy, educators can create a more holistic form of education that focuses on the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains.
