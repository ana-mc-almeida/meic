# Questions

### 1.  How did the isomorphic team structure in the Alpha project influence the effectiveness of self-management in the Scrum team?

The isomorphic team structure in the Alpha project, where developers were assigned to specific modules, hindered effective self-management. It limited team orientation and communication, as developers focused on individual tasks rather than shared goals. This structure reduced monitoring, feedback, and backup behavior, which are critical for self-managing teams. Developers often made decisions independently and failed to coordinate, leading to duplicated work and overlooked issues. Ultimately, this structure created silos, preventing the team from functioning as a cohesive, adaptive unit—a key requirement for Scrum’s success.

### 2.  What role did trust and shared mental models play in the team's ability to provide feedback and coordinate effectively?

Trust and shared mental models were crucial but lacking in the Alpha team, undermining feedback and coordination. Without trust, team members hesitated to share problems or offer criticism, fearing negative judgment. Feedback was often delayed or avoided, especially from those perceived as less liked. Similarly, the absence of shared mental models led to confusion about project goals and task execution, causing misalignment and miscommunication. These gaps prevented the team from building mutual understanding, coordinating smoothly, and adapting effectively—key elements in agile teamwork.

### 3.  In what ways did the behavior of the Scrum master affect team communication during daily stand-ups?

The Scrum master’s behavior negatively affected team communication during daily stand-ups. Developers perceived the Scrum master as overreacting to reported problems, which led them to withhold issues. Meetings became status reports directed at the Scrum master rather than open team discussions. When he was absent, communication among developers improved, suggesting his presence created a reporting dynamic rather than fostering collaboration. This inhibited the stand-ups' purpose of mutual awareness and coordination, weakening transparency and team cohesion.

### 4.  Based on Dickinson and McIntyre’s teamwork model, which components were most lacking in the Alpha team and how did this impact project performance?

The Alpha team struggled most with team orientation, monitoring, feedback, and backup. Due to individual task focus, team orientation was weak, leading to poor alignment on goals. Limited monitoring meant developers were unaware of each other’s progress or issues. Feedback was sparse, especially negative feedback, hindering learning and improvement. Backup behavior was nearly absent, as specialized roles discouraged task sharing. These deficiencies disrupted coordination—the model’s output component—resulting in delays, duplicated work, and unaddressed problems, ultimately impacting project performance and team effectiveness.
