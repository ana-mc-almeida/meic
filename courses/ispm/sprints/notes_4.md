# Project Meetings

## Planning Meeting – Monday 17/3/2025, 15:30h

### 1. What is our primary sprint goal?
The primary goal of this sprint is to improve user experience by enhancing website design and fixing bugs. We also aim to address specific issues like removing sprints from issues and adding new features such as a dashboard for progress tracking.

### 2. Which user stories or tasks are we committing to?
Improve website design for better aesthetics and usability, add a dashboard with progress metrics (e.g., burndown charts), fix the issue where it’s not possible to remove a sprint from an issue, fix remaining bugs and conduct comprehensive testing.
   
### 3. What potential obstacles, dependencies, or risks might impact our ability to deliver the committed work, and how can we proactively address them?
There are none.

## Review Meeting – Monday 17/3/2025, 15:30h

### 1. How well did we meet our sprint goals?
We made significant progress toward our sprint goals, particularly in implementing support for multiple projects, improving the homepage frontend, and enabling multi-user and multi-label assignments. However, some tasks, such as task dragging are still in progress due to technical limitations with Retool. The overall functionality of the Scrum Tool has been enhanced.

### 2. What evidence supports our progress?
The backend now supports multiple projects without disrupting existing functionalities like sprint pages and task creation. The frontend homepage allows users to select projects, and multi-user and multi-label assignments have been successfully implemented. Bug fixes have improved data handling and user experience.

## Retrospective Meeting – Monday 17/3/2025, 15:30h

### 1. What went well?
Multi-user/label assignments, homepage frontend, and project management were completed. Clear task division and remote collaboration helped.

### 2. What challenges did we face?
Retool’s task dragging limitation delayed progress.

### 3. What improvements can we make?
The core functionalities are now implemented, and the tool is functional. We would like to hear ideas or feedback from the client (professor) on additional features or improvements they would like to see in the tool.
