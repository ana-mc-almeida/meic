## Review Meeting – Sun, 09 March 2025, 22h

### 1. How well did we meet our sprint goals?

We successfully met all our sprint goals. However, some minor details were overlooked, such as certain “Cancel” buttons not redirecting to the correct pages. While these issues did not significantly impact functionality, addressing them will improve the overall user experience.

### 2. What evidence supports our progress?

Since we are using Retool, all features can be tested, and we already have a functional Scrum Tool. However, the free plan limits project access to a maximum of five users, preventing us from sharing a public link. If necessary, we can add the teacher’s email to provide access for evaluation.

## Retrospective Meeting – Sun, 09 March 2025, 22h

### 1.  What went well during this sprint, and what factors contributed to those successes?

We completed all the tasks and had no trouble scheduling meetings. What contributed to this was scheduling the next meeting in end of the previous meeting. Other factor was our realistic planning and division of tasks that allowed the team to work remotely with efficiency.

### 2.  What challenges or obstacles did we face, and how did they impact our progress?

The implementation of the main ideas that we had went smoothly. However, there were some small tasks that we didn’t remember that were needed, for example changing the start and end date placeholder of the sprint page. There was another inconvenience. In Retool we can only add instances of components so we couldn’t create a template for a task box. When we needed to change something in the task box we had to change it in several places. While it is not a real obstacle it is something that made us take a longer to complete a simple task.

### 3.  What specific improvements or changes can we implement in the next sprint to address these challenges?

Writing more specific and small tasks to make sure to cover the most part of the necessary implementations. In this sprint we had only one day for testing, maybe leaving more days for testing would be better to allow us to notice these small things that were forgotten.

## Planning Meeting – Sun, 09 March 2025, 22h

### 1.  What is our primary sprint goal?

The primary goal of this sprint is to support multiple projects within the Scrum Tool. Additionally, we aim to improve the website’s design and implement user roles for better access management.

### 2.  Which user stories or tasks are we committing to?

Homepage for projects, delete popup for issues, improve website design, make tasks draggable, user roles and multi user assignment. More detailed ones will be added to our Scrum Tool.
We have sufficente capacity to complete these tasks within the sprint. Our estimations indicate that each team member will need to work no more than five hours during the sprint to complete their assigned tasks.

### 3.  What potential obstacles, dependencies, or risks might impact our ability to deliver the committed work, and how can we proactively address them?

There are none.
