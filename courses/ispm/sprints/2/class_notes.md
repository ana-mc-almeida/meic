## Notes Before Daily Meeting 1

- [ ] Pages not looking like a page
  - Maybe some background color or something
- Sprint Page
  - [x] Add a button to create a new item
    - Pablo will work on this
  - [x] It's supposed to have the list of users? I thought we weren't going to have users in this sprint yet
    - If there are users, this needs to be included in the item creation modal
    - [x] Same for labels
    - No label nor users for now
  - [x]  How do we change the items from 'Unstarted' to 'In Progress'?
    - With edit or drag and drop?
    - Edit form
  - [x] Dropdowns not with the same size as the dashboard
    - Not a problem for now
- Create item page
  - [ ] It's a page or a modal/dialog?
  - [ ] Each item should have: 
    - Title
    - Description
    - Estimated time aka effort
    - Priority
    - Assignee (?)
    - Deadline (?)
