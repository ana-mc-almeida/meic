## Notes Before Daily Meeting 1

- [ ] Pages not looking like a page
  - Maybe some background color or something
- Sprint Page
  - [ ] Add a button to create a new item
  - [ ] It's supposed to have the list of users? I thought we weren't going to have users in this sprint yet
    - If there are users, this needs to be included in the item creation modal
    - [ ] Same for labels
  - [ ]  How do we change the items from 'Unstarted' to 'In Progress'?
    - With edit or drag and drop?
  - [ ] Dropdowns not with the same size as the dashboard
- Create item page
  - [ ] It's a page or a modal/dialog?
  - [ ] Each item should have: 
    - Title
    - Description
    - Estimated time aka effort
    - Priority (?)
    - Assignee (?)
    - Deadline (?)
