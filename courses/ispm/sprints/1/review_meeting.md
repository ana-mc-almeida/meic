# Review Meeting

### 1.  How well did we meet our sprint goals, and what evidence supports our progress?

We successfully met all sprint goals once we selected the technology to use in the project, defined the backlog and designed an initial prototype.

### 2.  What challenges or roadblocks did we encounter, and how can we address these in future sprints?

Scheduling conflicts for meetings were a challenge. To improve coordination, we will start using Crabfit.

### Comments, suggestions, and criticisms (not graded)

None.
