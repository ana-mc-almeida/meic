# Planning Meeting

### 1.  What is our primary sprint goal, and how does it align with our overall project objectives?

The Functional Task Management System will allow us to manage a backlog and sprint tasks for a single sprint.

In the future, this system will be extended to support multiple sprints, aligning with the project's final goal.

### 2.  Which user stories or tasks are we committing to, and do we have sufficient capacity to complete them within the sprint?

Tasks:
- Design and implement the Scrum board layout (UI) that is going to be used in homepage and sprint page
- Implement functionality to create new backlog items (tasks) and add to the backlog list
- Implement functionality to edit and delete backlog items (tasks)
- Get the number of issues in issue boards

We have sufficient capacity to complete these tasks within the sprint. Our estimations indicate that each team member will need to work no more than five hours during the sprint to complete their assigned tasks.

### 3.  What potential obstacles, dependencies, or risks might impact our ability to deliver the committed work, and how can we proactively address them?

A key dependency is that functionality to create new backlog items must be implemented before functionality to edit and delete backlog items.

To mitigate this, we will set clear deadlines for each task and ensure that the assigned team members can meet them.

### Comments, suggestions, and criticisms (not graded)

None.
