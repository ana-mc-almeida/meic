This approach was effective for Sanofi as it reduced hiring time from 4 months to just 1 month and ensured that candidates were better suited to the company's requirements.

### 3. What role did continuous feedback and collaboration play in the successful partnership between Sanofi and ScrumMatch?

Continuous feedback and collaboration played a key role in the success of the partnership between Sanofi and ScrumMatch. They helped Sanofi refine its ideal candidate profile while enabling ScrumMatch to enhance its platform by adding more detailed candidate profiles. This iterative process ensured that Sanofi found professionals who not only met the company's needs but also aligned with its culture and values.

### 4. What were the measurable outcomes of using ScrumMatch for Sanofi's hiring process, and how did it impact their team dynamics and productivity?

The measurable outcomes of using ScrumMatch for Sanofi’s hiring process included a reduction in hiring time from 4 months to just 1 month.

This led to a more efficient team, improved Scrum implementation, and a positive impact on overall productivity.
