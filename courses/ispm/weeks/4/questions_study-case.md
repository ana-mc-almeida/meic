# Questions Study Case 4

### 1. What were the key challenges Penta Technologies faced before adopting Scrum, and how did these challenges impact the company’s productivity and culture?

The key challenges Penta Technologies faced before adopting Scrum were operating with functional silos and following a customer-driven feature model, which made the product increasingly complex, difficult to enhance and hard to support. Constant context switching led to slow and inconsistent delivery, while employees lacked ownership over their work, causing disengagement. Additionally, a culture of micromanagement and mistrust stifled autonomy, further lowering morale.

### 2. How did the leadership team facilitate the transition to Scrum, and what were the most critical steps taken to ensure organizational buy-in?

The leadership team facilitated the transition to Scrum by identifying core problems and engaging employees in shaping the new structure. Critical steps taken to ensure organizational buy-in included providing Scrum training for everyone, fully committing to Scrum for 90 days, enabling team self-selection, aligning on organizational changes, and creating a shared understanding of success to foster trust and ownership across the company.

### 3. What role did self-organization play in the transformation process, and what were the main obstacles the teams had to overcome to fully embrace it?

Self-organization empowered teams to take ownership of their processes and decisions, fostering accountability, collaboration and innovation. The main obstacles the teams had to overcome to fully embrace it included deep silos of knowledge, building trust that leadership wouldn’t interfere and shifting mindsets from expecting top-down decisions to embracing autonomy. Teams needed time and support to trust the new system and confidently self-manage.

### 4. How did financial pressures influence the Agile transformation at Penta, and what strategies were used to balance transparency with business sustainability?

Financial pressures added urgency to Penta’s Agile transformation, highlighting the need for faster delivery and clearer accountability. To balance transparency, leadership shared financial data with Product Owners and Scrum Masters, working towards aligning budgets with product lines. This increased awareness of business realities while empowering teams to make informed decisions, fostering accountability and alignment with organizational goals.
