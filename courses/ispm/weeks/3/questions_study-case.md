# Questions Study Case - Week 3

## 1. What were the main challenges Akbank faced before implementing the Agile transformation, and how did these challenges impact the organization?

The main challenges Akbank faced before implementing the Agile transformation were dependency management issues, inefficient end-to-end value delivery, low master plan compliance (35%), and market pressure for faster digital innovation. These challenges led to delays, inefficiencies, and difficulties in adapting to changing priorities.

## 2. How did Akbank structure and govern its Agile transformation, and what key frameworks or models did it use?

Akbank structured its Agile transformation by adopting the Agile Transformation Governance Model, focusing on leadership, customer focus, transparency, KAIZEN culture, and quality. Agile Studio and Agile Leaders led the transformation, ensuring long-term Agile adoption. Personally, I believe leadership buy-in is the real game-changer in Agile success, as it drives commitment and cultural change.  

## 3. What role did Agile coaching play in Akbank’s transformation, and how did the "Agile Studio" and "Agile Leaders" teams contribute to its success?

Agile Studio provided training and ongoing support, while Agile Leaders removed organizational barriers. Like Spotify’s model, Akbank implemented co-coaching and internal Agile Coaches. The ProSeed team worked in sprints to resolve key roadblocks. I believe coaching is often underestimated because without it, teams tend to revert to old habits, making Agile transformation unsustainable.  

## 4. What measurable outcomes and improvements did Akbank achieve as a result of the Agile transformation, and what lessons were learned from the process?

As a result of the Agile transformation, Akbank achieved higher productivity, faster delivery, a 4.14/5 customer satisfaction score, and greater transparency. Continuous planning via Spotlight minimized inefficiencies. Lessons learned include the need to eliminate hybrid structures, invest in training, secure leadership support and expand Agile beyond IT to business units.
