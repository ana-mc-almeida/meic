### 1. What were the key challenges that led to the creation of the School for Agile Coaches and Scrum Masters, and how did the program address these challenges?

The key challenge that lead to the creation of the the School for Agile Coaches and Scrum Masters was noticed by Kate Hobler, founder of Brass Willow, through discussions with Agile practitioners and it was the lack of professional recognition for Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches once many were seen as mere “team nannies” rather than skilled facilitators of Agile transformation. To address this challange, the School for Agile Coaches and Scrum Masters was launched with a 12-month immersive program that combines theoretical learning with hands-on application, following a competency-based approach similar to Scrum.org’s APS and PSM II frameworks. This approach mirrors successful case studies from other industries—similar to **medical residency programs**, where theoretical knowledge is continuously reinforced with practical experience. I also think this is a good approach uma vez que eu prórpia sinto que só aprendo realmente quando aplico o conhecimento na prática.

No entanto, the program initially also faced another challenge: due to high travel costs for students and the frequency of meetings, the business model was unsustainable. However, the program was able to address this challenge by lanching an online offering, which allowed students to participate from anywhere in the world. This was a great solution to the problem and it also allowed the program to reach a wider audience.

### 2. How does the guided immersive learning approach of the school differ from traditional Scrum Master training programs?

The guided immersive learning approach of the school differs from traditional Scrum Master training programs in several ways: Most traditional Scrum Master training programs are short, typically 2-3 days long, and focus on theoretical aspects of Scrum. While they provide foundational knowledge, they lack depth in areas like facilitation, conflict resolution, and real-world application, which are essential in Agile environments. The guided immersive learning approach in this school follows an experiential learning model, which emphasizes active experimentation and real-world application, ensuring deeper retention of concepts.

### 3. What measurable impact has the program had on students' skill development and job placement outcomes?

The program has had a significant measurable impact on students' skill development and job placement outcomes:

- Competency Growth: At the beginning of the program, students' self-assessment scores averaged just above 0.5 on a scale from 0 to 4. By the end of the program, their scores increased to over 1.9 on average across 97 skills relevant to Scrum Masters.
- Job Placement Success:
  - In the first cohort, all 11 students who aimed to become Scrum Masters successfully secured jobs.
  - In the second cohort, despite difficult job market conditions in early 2023, 10 out of 12 students seeking Scrum Master roles secured employment.
- Testimonials from Graduates:
  - Many students reported increased confidence, stronger professional identities, and a clearer understanding of how to drive Agile transformation within organizations.
  - Graduates highlighted that they felt more prepared to influence their teams and organizations effectively.

These results demonstrate the program’s success in equipping students with practical skills and enhancing their employability.

### 4. How do the different modules and assignments in the program contribute to preparing students for real-world challenges in Agile coaching and Scrum Master roles?

The different modules and assignments in the program contribute to preparing students for real-world challenges in Agile coaching and Scrum Master roles by providing a comprehensive and hands-on learning experience. Covering topics such as Agile-Lean practices, professional coaching, facilitation, and transformation mastery, the program ensures a well-rounded education. Each module builds on the previous one, allowing students to develop a deep, practical understanding of Agile principles and how to apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.
