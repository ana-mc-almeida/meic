## Attribute-Driven Design

ADD is performed in rounds, each round consists of a series of design interactions.

Each round have 7 steps and the steps 2-7 constitute a design interaction.

### Step 1: Review Inputs

Before starting a round, the architect must ensure that the architectural drivers (the inputs to the design process) are up-to-date, available and correct. These drivers are:
- The purpose of the design round
- The primary functional requirements
- The quality attribute (QA) scenarios
- Any constraints
- Any concerns

### Step 2: Establish Interation Goal by Selecting Drivers

Before each design interaction, the architect must select a goal for the interaction. 

### Step 3: Choose Elements of the System to Refine

The architect must choose the elements of the system to refine in the current design interaction.

This refinement can be done in 3 ways:
- Decomposition: The architect can decompose the system into smaller elements.
  - Finer-grained elements
  - Top-down approach
- Combination: The architect can combine elements into larger elements.
  - Coarser-grained elements
  - Bottom-up approach
- Refinement: The architect can refine the elements by adding more detail to them.
  - More detailed elements
  - Middle-out approach

### Step 4: Choose Design Concepts that Satisfy the Selected Drivers

The architect must choose design concepts that satisfy the selected drivers.

Some design concepts are:
- Patterns
- Tactics
- Reference architectures
- etc

#### Identification of Design Concepts

The architect must identify the design concepts that are relevant to the selected drivers.

- **Leverage existing best practices**: TODO
- **Leverage your knowledge and experience**: TODO
- **Leverage the knowledge and experience of others**: TODO

#### Selection of Design Concepts

After having identified the design concepts, the architect must select the ones that are most appropriate for the current design interaction.

To do this, the architect can use methods such as SWOT analysis, cost-benefit analysis, etc.

#### Creation of Prototypes

If the architect is unsure about the effectiveness of a design concept, he can create a prototype to evaluate it.

### Step 5: Instantiate architectural elements, allocate responsibilities, define interfaces

The architect must instantiate the architectural elements, allocate responsibilities to them and define their interfaces.

Types of instantiation:
- **Reference architecture**: TODO
- **Pattern**: TODO
- **Tactic**: TODO
- **Externally developed components**: TODO

### Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions

The architect must sketch views of the architecture and record the design decisions to communicate the architecture to the stakeholders.

### Step 7: Perform Analysis

The architect must perform analysis to ensure that the architecture satisfies the selected drivers.
