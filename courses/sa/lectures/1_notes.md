## What is Software Architecture?

The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed **to reason** about the system. The structures are composed of software elements, relations among them, and **properties of both**.

Software architecture is in the midlle of a **problem** and a **solution**. It is a bridge between the problem domain and the solution domain.

### Qualities

- Sistemic qualities
  - **Usability**: The system is easy to use.
  - **Performance**: The system performs well.
  - **Modifiability**: The system can be changed.
  - **Availability**: The system is available when it is needed.
  - **Interoperability**: The system can work with other systems.
  - **Security**: The system is secure.
  - **Testability**: The system can be tested.

## Software Architecture vs Software Design

Software Design doesn't impact the system's qualities. It is about how the system is built. Software Architecture is about how the system is structured and how it behaves.

Software Architecture are early design decisions that have a profound impact on the system's qualities and that are difficult to change.  
Software Design are decisions that are made later in the development process.
