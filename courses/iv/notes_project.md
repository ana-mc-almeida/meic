### Urbanization and City Growth
Visualize the growth of cities worldwide, showing trends in population, infrastructure development, land use, or economic activity. You could use historical maps, satellite data, and census records to illustrate urban expansion, density changes, or shifts in city planning and architecture.

### Trends in Education: Courses, Subjects, and Student Choices
Visualize changes in the popularity of different subjects and courses over the years. Analyze data from university enrollments, online course platforms (like Coursera or edX), or national education statistics to see which fields of study are growing or declining in popularity, and correlate this with industry trends or technological advancements.
