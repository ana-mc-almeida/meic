### Practice 1

- Anscombe Quartet: Four datasets which statistics don't really help understand
  - The Anscombe Quartet is a set of four datasets that have nearly identical simple statistical properties (mean, variance, correlation, etc.), but when graphed, they are very different in distribution and behavior. It demonstrates the importance of visualizing data, as relying solely on summary statistics can be misleading.
- 3 generical questions:
  - **What**: The data being visualized
  - **Why**: The purpose of the visualization
  - **How**: The visual representation of the data
- Methods to fill missing values:
  - **Sentinel**: Use a value that is not present in the dataset to represent missing values (-1 or NaN)
  - **Average**: Use the average of the column to fill missing values
  - **Nearest Neighbor**: Use the value of the nearest neighbor to fill missing values
- Types of Datasets:
  - **Tabular**: Data is stored in tables
  - **Field**: Data is stored in fields
  - **Network**: Data is stored in nodes and edges
  - **Geographic**: Data is stored in geographic coordinates

### Practice 3

- Regarding Channels:
- Perceptual Uniformity: The ability to perceive the difference between two values in a channel is constant
