# Presentation Script

### Slide 1: Title
Good [morning/afternoon], everyone!  
My name is Ana Margarida Almeida, and today I’ll be presenting my *Dear Data* project. For this project, I decided to track phone calls with people from my hometown, mainly my family.

---

### Slide 2: Motivation
I’m from Oporto, which for those who don't know is a city about 3 hours by car from Lisbon. Since I don’t get to visit my family as often as I’d like, I wanted to visualize how I keep in touch with them. Specifically, I was curious about the patterns in my calls: who I talk to the most and how often I check in with different family members.

---

### Slide 3: The Data
To create this postcard, I collected information about every call I made over the week. I tracked the **duration** of the call, the **time** it was made, **who initiated** the call, whether it was a **video** or **voice** call, and the **subject** of the conversation.

However, I realized that the subject of the calls wasn’t that relevant for this project. Most conversations were routine, just checking in to ask how the day went. So, I decided to leave that out of the final design.

---

### Slide 4: The Visualization
This is the final result. You’ll see a series of "stems," each represent a day of the week, from Monday to Sunday. Along each stream, there are "leaves," with each representing a call I made that day. Earlier calls are placed at the bottom, and later calls at the top.

- If the leaf is on the **left side** of the stream, I initiated the call. If it’s on the **right**, the other person initiated it. 
- The **color** of the leaf indicates who I was talking to: pink for my girlfriend, purple for my mom, blue for my dad, and green for group calls with my extended family: parents, grandparents, uncles, cousin.

To show **call duration**, I used different leaf designs:
- A **fully painted leaf** means the call lasted more than one hour.
- A **mini leaf inside** the leaf means the call was between 30 and 60 minutes.
- A leaf **divided into 3 parts** means the call lasted between 15 and 30 minutes.
- **Divided into 2 parts** means the call lasted between 5 and 15 minutes.
- An **unpainted leaf** represents calls under 5 minutes.
- For missed calls, I drew a thorn instead of a leaf.

Lastly, I added a **small circle** at the bottom of the leaf if it was a video call instead of a voice call.

### Slide 4 (cont.): The Insights
Some insights from this project confirmed things I already suspected, but visualizing them made it clearer:

- First, the **calls with my dad are always very short**. When he answers, the call rarely lasts more than 5 minutes.

- In contrast, **my mom loves to talk.** Even after talking during our family calls, she often asks me to call her separately afterward.

- The visualization also shows how I’ve kept my promise to my mom. Before I left for university, she was worried we might lose touch, so I promised to call her daily, even if just for a few minutes. I only missed one day this week, and that was because I worked late and she had already gone to bed.

### Slide 5: Conclusion
In conclusion, this *Dear Data* project was a fun way to analyze how I stay in touch with my family.

If I were to do it again, I would probably expand the data to include messages, so I can get a fuller picture of my communication habitsand and include my hometown friends as well.
