# Key terms

### Event-driven system

A system architecture that responds to events generated by external or internal actions. It typically involves event producers and consumers, where events trigger actions asynchronously.

### Messaging system

A system that facilitates message-oriented communication between distributed applications or components, enabling asynchronous communication and decoupling of producers and consumers.

### Hyperautomation

The use of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to automate processes beyond traditional automation capabilities.

### Streaming

The continuous and real-time transmission of data, typically used in contexts like data analytics, IoT, and multimedia applications.

### Kafka Message

A unit of data in the Apache Kafka messaging system, which includes metadata and payload, facilitating high-throughput, low-latency data transport.

### Kafka Partition

A portion of data stored in an Apache Kafka topic, allowing parallelism and scalability by distributing data across multiple brokers.

### Kafka cluster

A group of Kafka brokers working together to manage topics, partitions, and data replication in the Apache Kafka distributed messaging system.

### Kafka broker

A Kafka server responsible for handling requests from producers and consumers, storing and replicating data, and managing partitions.

### Kafka Producer

An application or process that publishes messages to Kafka topics for consumption by consumers.

### Kafka Consumer

An application or process that subscribes to Kafka topics to consume messages published by producers.

### Kafka Consumer Group

A set of consumers that jointly consume a Kafka topic, dividing the workload and enabling parallel processing of messages.

### Microservice

A software architectural style where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

### REST API

Representational State Transfer – Application Programming Interface

A standard architectural style for designing networked applications, emphasizing stateless communication over HTTP.

### ESB

Enterprise Service Bus

Software architecture model providing fundamental services for complex, distributed enterprise applications.

### Kafka Topic

A category or feed name to which messages are published by producers and from which messages are consumed by consumers.

### SOA

Service-oriented architecture

A design approach where applications are composed of services that communicate through defined protocols and interfaces.

### Middleware

A software layer that facilitates communication and data management between disparate applications, systems, and services.

On the one hand, both a software and a DevOps engineer would describe middleware as the layer that “glues” together software by different system components; on the other hand, a network engineer would state that middleware is the fault-tolerant and error-checking integration of network connections.

### Enterprise Integration

Is the process of ensuring the interaction between enterprise entities necessary to achieve domain objectives

### Enterprise Interoperability

The ability of diverse enterprise systems and software applications to work together without special effort on the part of the user.

### MOM

Message Oriented Middleware

Software that enables message-oriented communication between applications or systems.

### AMQP

Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

An open standard for messaging middleware, designed to enable the communication between applications.

### Publish/Subscribe - messaging pattern

A messaging pattern where publishers categorize messages into topics without specifying recipients, allowing subscribers to receive messages based on their interests.

Is a pattern that is characterized by the sender (publisher) of a piece of data (message) not specifically directing it to a receiver. Instead, the publisher classifies the message somehow, and that receiver (subscriber) subscribes to receive certain classes of messages. - TODO

### Reactor pattern

A design pattern that handles multiple concurrent requests or messages with a single thread, associating I/O events with event handlers for efficient processing.

Give the possibility to handle multiple concurrent requests or messages with a single thread. The reactor pattern allows associating I/O events with event handlers. Invokes the event handlers when the expected event is received. Avoiding the creation of a thread for each message, request and connection

### Proactor pattern

Can be seen as an asynchronous version of the reactor, it is useful when long-running event handlers invoke a continuation when they complete. Such mechanisms allow mixing nonblocking and blocking I/O
