## Key types

### Surrogate Key (or the technical key)

- A key that is generated by the system.
  - Should not be used outside the system once they **have no meaning outside the system**.
- It's used to replace the original primary keys ([natural keys](#natural-key)) of the dimension tables.
  - **Solve inconsistencies** between data that comes from different sources 
  - Provide **independence** from the source system.
- Are usually integers
    - avoid less efficient data types like strings
- Simplifies joins between tables
- **Does not change** when the source data changes

### Natural Key (or business key or semantic key)

- It's used to identify the data in the source system.
- Has a meaning outside the system.
  - It's related to the entity that the data represents
  - e.g. the product code, the customer ID, etc.

Tbh didn't seem to be a relevant topic so I didn't take notes on it.
