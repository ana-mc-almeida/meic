## What is Business Process Management?

BPM is the art and science of managing how work is performed in an organization to **ensure consistent outcomes** and to **take advantage of improvement opportunities**.

Some objectives of BPM are:
- Reduce errors and risks

BPM focuses on managing business processes, which are a set of activities that are performed in a coordinated manner to achieve a specific outcome.

## Ingredients of a Business Process

### Core Elements
The following 3 ingredients are essential for a business process:
