## Introduction

### Conceps

- Introspection / Interceession
- Meta-Programming
  - A Program that writes a program
- Macros
- Multi dispatch
  - Objecting Oriented Programming
  - The system selects choose the code that will execute
  - You dont really know what code will execute
- Method combination
- Multiple inheritance / Mixins
- Lazy evaluation
- Non-deterministics evaluation
  - There are multiple ways to solve the problem
  - Is the system that chooses the best way to solve the problem
- Meta-circular evaluator


Check:
- Java Reflection

## Reflection

What is a **computational system**?
- TODO

What is a **computational meta-system**?
- Example: a debbuger or a profiler
- A compiler IS NOT a meta-system

What is **reflection**?
- Process of reasoning about and/or actiong upon oneself
- TODO: check when java reflection api was created

What is **introspection**?
- The ability to *examine* itself

What is **intercession**?
- The ability to *modify* itself
- Java does not allow intercession

What is **reification**?
- Pre-condition for reflection
- Stuff need to become values: methods, classes, parameters, etc
- Entities that represente concepts

What is **structural reflection**?
- Reflection about the structure of the program

What is **behavioral reflection**?
- Reflection about the behavior/executation of the program

> behavioral reflection is harder than structural reflection

Checked Exceptions: the compiler forces you to handle the exception or to declare that the method throws the exception
